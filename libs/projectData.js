The main challenges were making sure that the images were not throwing off the user, or the aesthetics leaving the user confused and exiting before reaching their goal.

			'We explored multiple different styles I had come up with for their website and we went with a black and white theme that showcases their productions as soon as you enter the website. Then for each specific production page, we used high quality images & an engaging gallery with pleasurable colors that shows off their amazing work. My main objective was to develop a simple yet sophisticated website with a beautiful minimalistic architecture that works hand in hand with the clients works and productions. For a little contrast to the main page black and white, for each specific production page, the headings are specifically chosen colors from each production images.',
